### Android Galway Bus app using Clean Architecture/Architecture Components/Kotlin/Dagger


This was created as part of effort to get more familiar with use of Kotlin and the new [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
to develop Android applications and also to explore use of[Clean Architecture](hhttps://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) approach. It's heavily based on https://github.com/bufferapp/clean-architecture-components-boilerplate. This is stil work in progress and also, at least for now,
 have omitted `Mapper` classes (using same data model across the different layers....though this will likely change).

Note also that this is using REST endpoint provided by @appsandwich (Thanks Vinny!)
