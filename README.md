### Android Galway Bus app using Clean Architecture/Architecture Components/Kotlin/Dagger


Heavily based on https://github.com/bufferapp/clean-architecture-components-boilerplate. This is stil work in progress and also, at least for now,
 have omitted `Mapper` classes (using same data model across the different layers....though this will likely change).

Note also that this is using REST endpoint provided by @appsandwich (Thanks Vinny!)
