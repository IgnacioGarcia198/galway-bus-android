### Kotlin Multiplatform

Currently this project is being mostly used as platform to explore some of the relatively new Kotlin Multiplatform
capabilities.  There is now **kotlin-multiplatform** `ShareCode` module for example and some sample iOS apps in `ios` folder. Have also 
written a couple of post about some of my experiences doing this so far
